Sat Feb 27, 2010 - v0.5.2
- Re-releasing under MIT License.
- Fixed issue with the add() method where if you added a group outside
  of the import_config() method, the group would not be properly added to
  self.groups[].
- Added feature that if you attempt to add a group that already exists, the
  groups will be merged together.  Any existing params in the original
  group will be overwritten by the new ones.
- Fully deprecated override_value() and nil_value().  Anything using
  'instance_variable*' has been removed as well as it wasn't working properly
  anyway.
- If you attempt to add_to_group() to a group that doesn't exist, the group
  is added automatically.

Mon Aug 31, 2009 - v0.5
- Added sub-groups feature per RubyForge tracker [#27019].  Config files
  can now have [subgroups] whose values are added to a nested Hash object.
- Added the write() function per RubyForge tracker [#27019].  Will print
  to STDOUT by default, or to a file object if passed.
- Added the add(), and add_to_group() functions to support new features
  per RubyForge tracker [#27019].
- Thank you to Titouan Christophe for the submissions listed above!
- ParseConfig.get_params() returns all params including groups.
  ParseConfig.get_groups() returns available sub-groups.
- See the demo.rb and demo.conf files which have been updated to reflect
  this update.
- The methods override_value() and nil_value() are now deprecated and will
  be removed in future versions.
